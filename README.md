# Authorisation Form
## Project #43 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project is my first React application that checks if the user's password is correct before showing placeholder contact details. The authorisation layer was accomplished using the React component "Contact". By entering the password "swordfish" (all lowercase), the contact page is displayed. Any incorrect passwords simply refresh the page.
## What I Learned
  - The syntax of React components and their special methods such as constructor() and render()
  - Working with states that store property values belonging to components
  - Using JSX elements to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM
  - Deploying a static website with Netlify
